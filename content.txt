    > code walkthrough
    > attribute get called itself, methods are called manually
3. why python is called object oriented programming ? - everything in python is an object (data structure, data type, etc)
4. Advantages of OOPS concept
    > you can create your own datatype
    > code reusability
    > debugging
    > easy to colab
5. End to end project (chatbook class)
    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method
